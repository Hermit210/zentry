# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing and completing the Zentry Cloud backend API. The current backend has several missing features, inconsistencies, and incomplete implementations that need to be addressed to provide a fully functional cloud platform API. The goal is to ensure both the simple demo backend and the full Supabase-powered backend work correctly with all expected features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Authentication System

**User Story:** As a developer using the Zentry Cloud API, I want a fully functional authentication system with proper error handling and token management, so that I can securely access protected endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and return a JWT token
2. WHEN a user signs up with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with appropriate message
3. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token and user information
4. WHEN a user logs in with invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error
5. WHEN a user accesses a protected endpoint with a valid token THEN the system SHALL allow access
6. WHEN a user accesses a protected endpoint with an invalid token THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error
7. WHEN a user requests their profile information THEN the system SHALL return current user data including credits

### Requirement 2: Complete VM Management System

**User Story:** As a cloud platform user, I want comprehensive VM management capabilities including creation, monitoring, and lifecycle management, so that I can effectively manage my virtual infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a VM with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL create the VM and deduct appropriate credits
2. WHEN a user creates a VM without sufficient credits THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error
3. WHEN a user starts a stopped VM THEN the system SHALL update the VM status to running
4. WHEN a user stops a running VM THEN the system SHALL update the VM status to stopped
5. WHEN a user restarts a VM THEN the system SHALL cycle the VM through stopped and running states
6. WHEN a user deletes a VM THEN the system SHALL mark the VM as terminated
7. WHEN a user requests VM pricing information THEN the system SHALL return current pricing and specifications
8. WHEN a user lists VMs THEN the system SHALL return all VMs belonging to the user with current status

### Requirement 3: Project-VM Relationship Management

**User Story:** As a cloud platform user, I want to organize my VMs within projects, so that I can better manage and group related resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a VM THEN the system SHALL require a valid project_id
2. WHEN a user creates a VM with an invalid project_id THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error
3. WHEN a user creates a VM THEN the system SHALL verify the project belongs to the user
4. WHEN a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL handle associated VMs appropriately
5. WHEN a user lists projects THEN the system SHALL optionally include associated VM counts

### Requirement 4: User Profile and Credit Management

**User Story:** As a cloud platform user, I want to manage my profile information and monitor my credit usage, so that I can maintain my account and track spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL save the changes and return updated information
2. WHEN a user requests their credit balance THEN the system SHALL return current credits and usage history
3. WHEN a user performs billable actions THEN the system SHALL automatically deduct appropriate credits
4. WHEN a user's credits fall below a threshold THEN the system SHALL prevent new resource creation
5. WHEN an admin adds credits to a user THEN the system SHALL update the user's balance

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the Zentry Cloud API, I want consistent error responses and proper validation, so that I can handle errors gracefully in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with detailed validation messages
2. WHEN a resource is not found THEN the system SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate message
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return a 401 error with proper headers
4. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL return a 403 error
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return a 500 error and log the issue
6. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a 429 error

### Requirement 6: Database Schema and Migration Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper database schema management and migration support, so that I can deploy and maintain the system reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify database connectivity
2. WHEN database tables don't exist THEN the system SHALL provide migration scripts
3. WHEN the database schema needs updates THEN the system SHALL support versioned migrations
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN the system performs health checks THEN it SHALL verify database status

### Requirement 7: API Consistency and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer using the Zentry Cloud API, I want consistent API responses and comprehensive documentation, so that I can integrate efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return responses in consistent format
2. WHEN the API documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL include all endpoints with examples
3. WHEN endpoints return lists THEN they SHALL support pagination where appropriate
4. WHEN endpoints return data THEN they SHALL include proper HTTP status codes
5. WHEN the API version changes THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility

### Requirement 8: VM Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a cloud platform user, I want to monitor my VM performance and usage metrics, so that I can optimize my resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests VM metrics THEN the system SHALL return CPU, memory, and disk usage
2. WHEN a VM status changes THEN the system SHALL log the state transition
3. WHEN a user requests usage history THEN the system SHALL return historical data
4. WHEN VMs are running THEN the system SHALL track uptime and billing
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN the data SHALL be available via API

### Requirement 9: Billing and Usage Tracking

**User Story:** As a cloud platform user, I want detailed billing information and usage tracking, so that I can understand and control my costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs billable actions THEN the system SHALL record usage details
2. WHEN a user requests billing history THEN the system SHALL return itemized charges
3. WHEN VMs are running THEN the system SHALL calculate hourly charges
4. WHEN billing periods end THEN the system SHALL generate usage summaries
5. WHEN credits are consumed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed breakdowns

### Requirement 10: Development and Production Environment Support

**User Story:** As a developer and system administrator, I want the backend to work seamlessly in both development and production environments, so that I can develop locally and deploy reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL use in-memory storage for quick testing
2. WHEN running in production mode THEN the system SHALL use persistent database storage
3. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL maintain API compatibility
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL include proper security configurations
